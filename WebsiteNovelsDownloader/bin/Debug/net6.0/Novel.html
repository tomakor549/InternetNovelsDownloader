<p><b>Chapter 5: The Lion King’s Proposal (2)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The space distorted, and a female Streamer, Senia, appeared from within. She was a terribly beautiful Streamer, but she didn’t look beautiful at all to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Tutorial Field will be altered according to the suggestion of the Courageous Lion King.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These kinds of events happened sometimes. A Guardian could use their special authority to make slight alterations. I knew what the Lion King would propose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I hoped this wouldn’t happen.’ I bit my lip a little. ‘He will definitely try to induce me to fight.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The best method at his disposal is to destroy the conditional Safe Zone.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardians were limited in how they could engage with Players. They could do things like support a Player or sponsor them with COIN, but there were many restrictions on direct interference with Playing. But this was still within their limits. They could still ask an Intermediate Administrator to destroy a conditional Safe Zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The trade has been concluded. According to the request of the Courageous Lion King, the conditional Safe Zone will be abolished in thirty seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She unblinkingly spoke such words with complete indifference, despite knowing all too well that I could not handle a Goblin swarm with my current strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I know you’re aware of that fact and more. I know about this world very well.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was possible that I knew more about the world than Senia. The Kim Hyukjin who became a Playing nerd over the three years of test prep was not to be underestimated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, “If a Guardian forcefully alters the scenario, shouldn’t there be a corresponding reward for the Player?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia simply stared at me with her emotionless face. I couldn’t read her expression, but it looked like she was saying that the complaints of a level 1 insect mattered not a whit to her. She also wasn’t very ruffled by my talking down on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Laws cannot be ignored, especially if it is related to my life or death. You cannot ignore the Commandments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard a notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ expresses their surprise.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Courageous Lion King’ is silent.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you just say Commandments?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. Commandments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this System, there were rules, aka Commandments, that pervaded the entirety of the System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know about the Commandments?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that important?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could that be important when I was at the fork between life and death?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure you know that a Player doesn’t have to concretely explain their Playing methods, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia didn’t say anything. Streamers were generally talkative, but this one seemed a little different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The reason why such a beautiful person didn’t become well-known… must be linked to that frustratingly tight-lipped nature.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced at the time. Ten seconds had already passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve lost out on Safe Zone time talking to you, the Intermediate Administrator. My reward?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In accordance with the Commandments, I will increase the Safe Zone time. The Safe Zone will remain in effect for ten seconds after your conversation with me ends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was excellent. That was exactly what I wanted. The 1st wave of Goblin attacks would end very soon. I only had to hold out for a little longer. The Courageous Lion King tried to start some nonsense, but it didn’t matter—the time was passing all the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke again, “This is a scenario alteration linked to my life or death. I think an appropriate reward is in order. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me ask again. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guessed she was rather flustered. A level 1 piece of trash was speaking to a Streamer with such impoliteness, yet there was no justification for punishment. That was because my argument was related to the ‘Laws’, or ‘Commandments’ that were only discovered seven years in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She might be happy right now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My actions right now were definitely eye-catching and likely to draw the interest of many Guardians, so it could very well be that this Streamer was inwardly delighted by my actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;” After a short moment, she said, “Player Kim Hyukjin. Your words are correct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said that, an item was sent into my Inventory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Quality Lubricant]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good quality lubrication oil. It can sharpen the blade of an item with an edge, or be applied on a part that requires lubrication. It is characterized by its tremendous slickness.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The scenario alteration reward is only this?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My face twisted into a slight frown. It seemed a bit weak for a reward. Still, a reward was a reward, and I had dragged out the time for as long as possible while talking to the Streamer, the Intermediate Administrator. That was a very valid way to think about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Lion King. You idiot.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lion King actually ended up helping me. Thanks to him, I was able to drag out plenty of time, and do it safely. I’m sure nobody expected a level 1 Player to bring up the ‘Commandments’ in a little trick to drag out the time. Of course, that applied to me as well. Such a method only occurred to me on the fly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The 1st wave of Goblin attacks is over.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Courageous Lion King’ is deeply disappointed.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I survived the 1st wave.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t be sure, but the damned Courageous Lion King was probably scratching his ass like a dog with hemorrhoids. Why? Because the Goblins were going to disappear now from this field.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikik? Kikik! Kiiik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins began to move. They had come like the rising tide, and now, they were disappearing like receding waters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is my chance.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I jumped to my feet. The Streamer Senia leveled her gaze on my every movement, neither helping nor interfering. Seeing as she hadn’t yet disappeared, it seemed she had a certain degree of interest in me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed for the bus exit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Urgh…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gruesome hell was laid out before me. There was hardly an intact body to be found. Up until a few moments ago, it was the inside of an all-too-ordinary bus commonly seen on the morning commute, but now, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> corpses were scattered about, some ripped to pieces and some missing parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Eughh.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bile rose in my throat. It was terrible. I didn’t want to look anymore. It felt like the splayed out man, whose arm was caught on the seat, was staring at me with his open, glassy eyes, like he would rise in the next moment and chase me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Come to your senses.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to keep it together. This was the Tutorial Field, a place with an official survival rate of just 3 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have to hold out for one week.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One week—that was how long I had to endure. I had ridden this bus day after day for three years and frequently went through this area. At the very least, I knew exactly where the streetside convenience stores were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The fog’s grown thicker.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After pushing open the bus door, I descended. The disgusting sewer smell together with the intense reek of blood crashed into me. I was actually glad the fog was there. If I had seen this place in the bright light of day with a clear line of sight, I might have gone insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘First of all, I need water and food.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was nearly impossible to survive without drinking for seven days. The convenience store was my first destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a total of ten minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Let’s go.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly enough, I moved as naturally as a person who had Played before, like someone who had done this many times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even up until that point, I hadn’t really realized how high my Intelligence was.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My surroundings looked very hazy. I saw cars amidst the metallic bloody stench, and bodies made into a mess of bright red blood were scattered along the pathway. From the midst of that devastation came the voices of survivors. Inside the fog, eyesight and hearing were greatly inhibited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Considering we’re in the fog… quite a few people survived the 1st wave of Goblin attacks.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started running towards the convenience store. They said your sense of direction would pretty much disappear in this fog, and that seemed about right. I glanced back at the blue bus; After just a few steps, it was barely visible. I ran with the bus at my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is the right way.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I went this way, there would be a convenience store not far from here. I ran forward, relying on my senses. A distance that had to be less than 300 meters felt so inexplicably long. I found out for the first time that I valued ‘life’ so fiercely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as I ran, my foot hit something, most likely a person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is it another body?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no, it wasn’t a body. Under my foot… lay a person who was not yet a corpse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sobbing voice sounded in my ears. “H-Help me. Please. Please save me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a young girl in her early teens. Paralyzed with fear, the child was laying on the ground covering her head, trembling. She raised her head and stared at me with the gaze of a child looking at an adult, a gaze yearning for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly heard the sound of something being sliced. At that moment, I could only flinch in alarm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s a Goblin here?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t seen it because of the fog, but there was still a Goblin here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Even though the 1st wave of the Goblin attacks is over?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to countless records and VR dungeon simulations, the Goblins should be completely gone. That was the established theory, and none of the many guides described anything like this. In other words, this Goblin was a ‘variable’.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikik. Kikikik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about fifty centimetres tall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s not an adult?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t an adult Goblin, but a young one. Even so, it apparently knew a measure of the disgusting Goblin tastes, because it was hard at work slicing the girl’s ankles with the dagger in its hand. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slice, slice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—came the gruesome sound. Faced with such a situation, I struggled to make a choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Do I run?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To run, or not to run? To run, or not to run?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I do think I can defeat a baby Goblin, at least.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It varied per person, but the universal recommended level for hunting a Goblin was around 5. The one in front of me wasn’t a real Goblin, but a baby one. For me, with the starting stats of a top-level Player, a baby Goblin should be manageable, at least if I were given a little time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the sobbing voice again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heuk heuk. Please, help me, help me. Please, please, save me. I wanna see my mommy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bit my lips. It was possible I might lose my sense of direction completely if I stopped to help this girl. That meant I could be exposed to the 2nd wave with no defenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-Please. Save me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was in the middle of struggling to decide what to do, I suddenly realized one strange point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Come to think of it…’ Goosebumps rose on my arms. ‘I don’t see any blood. At all.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This girl… wasn’t even screaming in pain. She wasn’t screaming in pain, just crying out in shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be a baby Goblin, but there was still a dagger in its hands. It was using the blade to hack away at this schoolgirl’s ankles. It seemed the baby Goblin was completely absorbed with the task of cutting the girl’s ankles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She hasn’t taken any damage.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had this schoolgirl also received an Open Beta Bonus? She might have received something that could protect her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But even if that’s the case… How could a girl this young have…?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, she was a middle school student. It was known that ‘talent plates’ typically opened up the most from one’s late teens to early 20s, meaning this girl in her early teens hadn’t even properly opened up yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s blocking that dagger without any armor, with just the abilities of her bare body.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be impossible, even for the Fist King So Yoohyun at level 1. This girl didn’t even know about her own condition right now. She merely felt a sharp sensation at her ankles with some slicing noises. In her state of panic, she didn’t even realize that she was still perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is this… the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">talent</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve only heard about?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would happen if she were given a chance to really grow? And if he could make her an ally? Or even if he could just make her indebted to him for saving her life?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In the worst case scenario, she could…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There probably wouldn’t be many opportunities like that, but this girl’s ‘resilience’ could be a huge help to me in the worst case scenario. She was orders of magnitude different from a guy like me who had received a ‘No Talent’ evaluation because I had no talent plates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s no time.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2nd wave of attacks would soon begin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having followed me, Senia said, “Even though it is a baby Goblin, it would be very difficult for someone with level 1 abilities to defeat.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia had apparently recognized me as ‘good quality content’. It seemed she had at least judged that it would be a waste to let me die here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I will…!’</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 6: Level 8 in Practice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew the strategies for clearing the Tutorial very well. No, not just the Tutorial, but all the events that would happen afterwards. After all, that was what I had memorized by rote for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I know about this field better than anyone.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t have the time, the leisure, or the money. Although hobbies were a luxury for me, I still had one. There was just one thing I had enjoyed, and that was sitting in front of the 10-year-old computer in my half-basement room and watching Youtube videos with the resolution fully turned down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘When it comes to the theory, I’m way more knowledgeable than most Players.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no talent. That was the evaluation I received. In a world of Players where talent was valued over all else, ‘No Talent’ meant you couldn’t rise to the top on effort alone. The talentless me simply browsed Youtube dungeon strategy videos several times over, dreaming of a reality that couldn’t be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even though it is a baby Goblin, it would be very difficult for someone with level 1 abilities to defeat it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words were meaningless to me. Fighting it head on would be difficult, but I knew its weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A Goblin’s weakness.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected of a low-rank monster, Goblins had one weakness that could be easily exploited.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikik! Kikikikik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The baby Goblin was still focusing on cutting the young girl’s ankles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The back of the neck.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I breathed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The center of the back of the neck.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the center, there was a large black dot. That was a fatal weak point where a good hit could cause instant death to the Goblin. Actually, as long as you knew its weakness, a Goblin was an easy monster to conquer. It was just that they tended to move in swarms, the numbers being problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Inventory.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, it seemed as if a faint light was coming from my hand, and then an item appeared in my grip. To me, it wasn’t that shocking a sight.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[Equipped the Rusted Iron Sword.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stealthily walked to the back of the baby Goblin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’ll pierce it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was someone who had struggled to kill a single big cockroach before this. I bit my lips hard. I had to completely resolve myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Die!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding the Rusted Iron Sword, I plunged the blade into the back of the baby Goblin’s neck.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squelch!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the tip of the blade, to the hilt of the sword, to my hand, I felt the chilling sensation of piercing through flesh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I-I did it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I killed it in one blow.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splurt!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood splattered, and a part of it landed on my clothes, but I paid it no heed. I didn’t have the time for that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Baby Goblin has been killed.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[EXP acquired.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t visible to the eye, but I was able to confirm that I had received EXP. It was a feeling that automatically appeared in my head. A third of the EXP bar filled up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I really killed it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in one blow. Yes, it was only a baby Goblin, and yes, I knew the strategy, but that I was able to kill it in one blow could only be described as having good luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I was lucky.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really not easy for a total beginner, no matter how high their starting stats, to kill a monster in one hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Wait… Was it really lucky?’ I couldn’t be sure. Such a situation could only be described as lucky, but… ‘Why is it so easy?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, it was too easy. It was a little iffy to say it boiled down ‘being lucky’. My hand went through the motions as if familiar with them, like I had been Playing since long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed this situation was unexpected for Streamer Senia as well. Her mouth moved almost imperceptibly, and she spoke in a low voice. She was probably narrating the scene to the Guardians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A level 1 Player has killed a baby Goblin with just one attack.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was speaking calmly, but the tips of Senia’s wings were trembling. It was one of the characteristics of angel Streamers. Whenever there was a disturbance in their emotions, the tips of their wings would tremble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to handle the important matters in front of me first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get up.” The girl’s eyes lacked focus. “Get a hold of yourself. If you lose track of me, I’ll leave you behind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words must have had an effect, because the teenager snapped to her senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I’m coming.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked ahead of her. There wasn’t much time. Not long from now, the 2nd wave of attacks would begin.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered the convenience store. Glancing behind me, I saw that the girl was trailing closely in a half-conscious state. I closed the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia was standing amidst the Goblin swarm, looking noble as she stood there all alone while describing the scenery around her. Perhaps she had set me as her main target, because she didn’t stray far from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter what happens from now on, don’t open this door.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understood the girl had been in huge shock, but I had no intention of entertaining excessive childishness. Because this was the Tutorial Field, where 14,500 out of 15,000 people perished, and because I wouldn’t do something so foolish as surrendering my life in order to take care of one kid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Answer me. Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter who comes, even if they ask you to open it, you must never, ever open the door.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I understand. I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was completely taken over by fear. To her, I was probably simultaneously her life’s savior and a monstrous man who had stabbed a terrifying green beast to death. Her fear was understandable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The 2nd wave of Goblin attacks will soon begin.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The establishment of Safe Zones is beginning.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, “You hear the notices too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-Notices?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The voice you hear in your head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed this girl had thought of this sound not as a ‘notice’, but something like an ‘auditory hallucination’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you hear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soon… an attack will be starting. And that Safe Zones are being established…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-The school and convenience store, the hospital… they’ve been established as Safe Zones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My guess that this girl had awakened as a Player was correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘So she heard the hospital.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with a normal amount of talent would only hear up to the ‘convenience store’. People with more outstanding talent would hear the ‘hospital’ as well. That was what was known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But wait, didn’t I hear the hospital too?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I even heard an additional notice.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[In addition, the 2nd floor of the D-Tower parking lot is being established as an extra Safe Zone.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stared at the girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I don’t think she heard that?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hadn’t said anything afterwards, so it seemed she hadn’t heard ‘2nd floor of the D-Tower parking lot’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What’s going on?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a bit of panic. There was another Safe Zone other than the hospital? That was something I hadn’t known at all. Such a Safe Zone didn’t show up even in the memoir of the Tutorial Ender, Fist King So Yoohyun. None of the past Players had said anything about there being another Safe Zone in the Tutorial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And it’s the D-Tower parking lot of all places?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was there always a Safe Zone in the central field of the Tutorial, the ‘D-Tower’? If there was, it wasn’t widespread knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The establishment of Safe Zones has concluded.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to steel myself. Soon, hell would break loose. Those who hadn’t found a Safe Zone, those who hadn’t gone into the buildings fast enough, they would all die.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t open the door, ever. Actually, don’t even look in the direction of the door and sit down with your back to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was an established Safe Zone. It was impossible to forcibly break in. Breaking the glass door to come in was also impossible, for monsters and people alike. Only a Player or monster of a rank that exceeded the establishment parameters could break in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s no one like that in the Tutorial.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the door was opened from within, the Safe Zone would be deactivated, and I would have no choice but to greet a gruesome death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Primordial Fog is starting to recede.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world outside the window was ghastly. Laying here and there were corpses. It was as if the city had been painted with crimson red paint. There were pieces of people, not mannequins, scattered about, and the road was absolute pandemonium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-O-Open the door! I said open the door!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open up! Open the door. I’m begging you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of people,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banged on the door of the convenience store. I didn’t open it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Dammit.’ I bit my lips and clenched my fists. ‘This is… truly painful.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Goblins were forming swarms. People gathered in small groups to put up a resistance, but as expected, they couldn’t deal with those numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could only watch from this spot—a safe place—as people died and were eaten alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Dammit!!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t turn away from any of it. I had to watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’ll… remember it all.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I would fuck over the System and the Guardians that created this situation and were watching this hell like they were enjoying a game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This moment, this scene. I won’t forget it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Never. I’ll never forget.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day passed. The girl’s name was Kang Sunhwa. She was in her first year of middle school. At first, she was frozen in fear, but she recovered fairly quickly—her mental fortitude was stronger than expected. It was a relief that she got a hold of herself quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um… may I call you oppa?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TN: Oppa is a familiar term used by girls for an older man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave a slight nod. Oppa was correct, because mister wasn’t quite right. My mental age aside, I had returned to twenty years of age. With a six year difference between us, oppa was about right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After around six hours since the beginning of the 2nd wave, it became rather quiet. By which I meant, there weren’t that many living people nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. For saving me. I haven’t thanked you properly yet. I was just so scared…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the way her eyes reddened while speaking, it seemed she hadn’t quite gotten over her shock. Yes. That was normal. But still, it was pretty impressive. She looked pretty calm—at least on the outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so glad I met you, oppa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation became rather one-sided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please don’t throw me away. I’m a really good girl. I’m good at washing dishes, cleaning, and tidying my clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh. That so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For words spoken by a 14-year-old, they were a bit strange. I was surprised she suddenly asked me not to throw her away. People didn’t usually say things like that, even with the situation being the way it was, right? Was it because she was that scared of being abandoned? I didn’t know how to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was true that I saved this girl, but it was also a calculated move, not out of the sheer kindness of my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s enough with the thanks. We don’t know if either of us will survive to the end anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Still…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If necessary, I will use you as bait and make a run for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa’s face darkened. I decided to give it to her straight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another six hours passed. In the meantime, Sunhwa had apparently gotten more familiar with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I can survive if I’m with oppa. Though I’m just as scared as before…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attempted a fairly bright smile, trying to put on a brave front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s cute.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was pretty cute. There wasn’t much meaning behind it, just that she was cute. Obviously, it was absolutely not as a man to woman sense. How should I say it? She was kinda like a niece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa looks very strong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I were strong, I would have gone out there and killed them all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pointed out the window. Outside the Safe Zone, Goblins were staring at us, snickering and slamming their clubs into the window. Almost as if we were animals trapped in a zoo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shriek, Sunhwa scrambled backwards on her butt and hid behind me. She had a really small build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Oppa, aren’t you scared?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who knows?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scared. But more pressing than my fear was my anger, the helplessness of not being able to do anything. That was more present in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘After the 2nd wave of attacks…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the end of the Goblins’ 2nd wave of attacks, it was all about staying hidden. But once the 2nd wave ended, things would change a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I might not be able to protect you for the seven days of the Tutorial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I can’t take complete responsibility for you, either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking after myself was hard enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, I won’t leave you here if nothing happens, so get some rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa stared at me with eyes full of tears. It seemed she thought I would leave her and go if she fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey. I won’t. Unless it’s a situation where my life’s in danger, I won’t throw you away, so trust me and go to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You really won’t? I can trust you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was rather scared of being abandoned. I said, as if annoyed, “Just trust me. Even if you don’t, what can you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-That’s true,” Sunhwa said, looking defeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So get some rest for now. You’ll need your energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. I’ll do as you say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the 2nd wave of attacks, I would have to walk through the road littered with corpses. My destination would be the crux of clearing the Tutorial, which coincidentally happened to be the ‘Gwanghwamun D-Tower’, the location of the established Safe Zone that no one else had heard of.</span></p>

<div class="wrapper-div">[The convenience store Safe Zone has been deactivated.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put food and water into my Inventory and left. Having no proper means of transportation, we would have to walk all the way from the store to the D-Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doing alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A response came from behind me. “I’m alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must have been brutal sights, difficult for a 14-year-old to handle, but Sunhwa looked fairly calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How could she be alright?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way she was. If I listened carefully, I could hear something like sniffling and sobbing behind me. I didn’t check to see, but she was probably crying. There was no way she’d seen anything like this before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I wonder if this is what a city on the verge of ruin, no… an already ruined city feels like.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt like the entirety of Jongno had become a ghost town.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I wonder if there are even 10,000 people still alive by now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was my best guess, but in all actuality, the number wasn’t the important thing right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can’t see any people.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were corpses, not people, lining the road. Inside a car, sitting in the driver’s seat, was a headless… I made myself stop there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep your eyes on the ground. Be sure to tell me if you see any jelly-like thing crawling around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to D-Tower, we had to hunt. Our primary goal was ‘Slimes’. As ‘neutral’ monsters, they didn’t attack unless attacked first. Their levels were marked as ‘-’. They were the safest monsters, ones that even a 10-year-old child could kill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa, there’s one over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also spotted the jelly-shaped monster crawling out from under a car.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Slime. -]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, it had no levels and was marked with a ‘-’. I approached the Slime and swung my sword. As could be expected from its jelly shape, there was a sloshing sensation, but the damage was properly inflicted. They weren’t hard to kill.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It disappeared.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. They’re really weak monsters. Let’s go. We have to keep killing them while we walk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here as well, I could feel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why’s it so easy?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how weak a monster it was, it felt way too easy. I had felt this from the start, but it felt like I had always been Playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This Rusted Iron Sword…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I maybe use it in my dreams? Even if I did, for a weapon I’d never used before, it felt extremely familiar in my hand, almost as if I had trained with it for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep a good eye out for them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. I’ll try to find them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa did the best she could. Here, in this place littered with corpses, this gruesome place stained by pools of blood, she was adapting far better than I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa. There’s one here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her ability to find the monsters alone seemed far better than mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa, over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hunting about five Slimes, I heard the level up notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa stared at me in fascination. “Oppa, your body was shining just now. How come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I leveled up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leveled up?” She seemed amazed by leveling up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. You level up when you kill monsters. And when you level up, you become stronger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah… I see.” After a pause, “I also want to work hard to level up and become like oppa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa’s face was still full of curiosity, but perhaps because she didn’t want to annoy me, she didn’t pester me with more questions. I caught a few more Slimes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, I noticed that something was strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s weird.’ For some reason, I had the feeling I was leveling up too quickly. ‘Is it different when you Play in person?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only Playing I had experienced was in VR, like VR videos on Youtube and VR experiences like ‘virtual dungeons’, and the rote memorization of strategy guides through textbooks. That was the limit of my Playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In person, it actually feels like I’m leveling up really fast.’ That wasn’t all. ‘I’ve already gotten 2 random bonus stats.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Random bonus stats weren’t usually given that frequently. That applied in the Tutorial Arena as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The Fist King… So Yoohyun also said he hadn’t seen random bonus stats that often.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the pride of Korea, the named Player So Yoohyun who ranked within the top 10 in Korea when it came to talent, said it had been difficult for him to get bonus stats. But I had already earned two, and I was only at level 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly thought back to the evaluation results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No Talent.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days ago, those two words had stung particularly badly. I sorted the thoughts in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Did I gain talent I didn’t have in the process of returning to the past?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that wasn’t it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘An early bloomer Player who sees explosive growth only in the beginning.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That seemed like the most likely option. There were a lot of them in Korea as well. Countless Players had appeared like meteors and had faded just as quickly. Many Players, called ‘Rising Stars’ or ‘Super Rookies’, made their names with their explosive speed of level ups and incredible skills in the lower levels, but were unable to pass the middle levels and faded into obscurity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That I’m an early bloomer is the most likely possibility.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to think of it like that. I had to approach it this way so I wouldn’t be disappointed later. I’d look only a few steps ahead, not a few miles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘For now, it’s advantageous for me.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who had nothing, absolutely jack, returned to the past and somehow survived the 1st and 2nd Goblin waves, and even drew the attention of Guardians. Even assuming I was an early bloomer, I was already level 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The goal is to survive, and then…’ I came up with a goal. ‘$1 million.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was my goal. Even an early bloomer Player could earn $1 million without much difficulty. With that much money, I would be able to get treatment for my mom. In three years, the ‘illness curing potion’ would be put on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Let’s not look too far ahead.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did want to strike down the Guardians, but that was too far in the future. I might even be an early bloomer Player. For now, my goal was to survive, and then, earn $1 million. I could think of what came afterwards later.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got bonus stats and random stats yet again. Before I knew it, I was level 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she accepted the party invite before long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t hear any notices from the ‘Courageous Lion King’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we continued to walk to D-Tower, the girl trailing behind me said, “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll do my best. I’ll be of help to oppa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was she on about all of a sudden again? I was about to say I’d leave her behind if she wasn’t helpful when she continued speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So… Please don’t throw me away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again? I really couldn’t understand why she was always begging not to be abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please don’t give up on me. I’ll really do my best.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did feel a little bad for her. What would drive such a young girl to say something like this? But I kept up a hard front and said, “Show me with your actions and not your words.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might’ve seemed cold, but I rationally laid out the reality. Half-assed sympathy or kindness would only harm the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I don’t need you, I will throw you away without hesitation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard enough to take care of myself. My leveling speed was much faster than expected and I had already gotten four random bonus stats, but that was nothing. When I hunted the monster waiting on the 1st floor of the D-Tower, there was no guarantee I could protect Sunhwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘To begin with… It was weird I’d be protecting anyone.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could a level 5 Player do? The path ahead was something you walked on your own. In any case, it seemed like my words had gotten through to Sunhwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, Sunhwa said, “Isn’t that… a different monster?”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Gwanghwamun area, in front of the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, were different monsters that weren’t Slimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘City Foxes.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their levels were ‘2’ or ‘3’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">City Fox LVL 3</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They weren’t difficult monsters to kill. But killing them felt way harder than Slimes. It was because I wasn’t used to killing living beings yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Even though the Goblins are dead.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall grey, fox-shaped monsters were ‘passive’ monsters. If you didn’t mess with them, they were neutral, but they would aggro the moment you attacked. Attacking one would draw others towards you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hm?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when Sunhwa said “Taunt,” a ‘!!!’ mark appeared above the heads of the City Foxes, and they came running towards Sunhwa. The City Foxes wildly bit at Sunhwa’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was shocked. ‘AOE aggro?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were just low-level monsters at level 2 or 3, and Sunhwa was only level 3, but she was able to achieve an AOE aggro of this level. It looked like she had taunted all of the City Foxes in the area, which looked to be about 14 foxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s not taking any damage.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t sitting around, sucking my thumb, either. Most animal monsters had the neck as the weak spot. I was able to hunt the City Foxes without difficulty. Leveling with Slimes was difficult now, but when I killed the City Foxes, my EXP shot up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of my fatigue disappeared with the level ups. That was a special characteristic of level ups—when you rose one level, all of your fatigue would fly away, and you would return to your best condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘My leveling speed is way faster than I thought.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was already level 8. If things had gone as I expected—educated guess from countless strats—I would be around level 5 by now. I thought I would just be getting to the Party System, but I was already level 8. It might seem as though level 5 and 8 weren’t that different, but that was absolutely not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘4 level ups vs. 7. In terms of speed, it’s nearly twice as fast.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going from level 4 to 8 was way harder than going from 1 to 4. With that in mind, I was leveling up at more than double the speed. Far faster than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is a crazy leveling speed.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so fast it was absurd. The Guardians seemed to think the same, because Senia, who had been wandering around, approached me. She captured the scene of me leveling up and asked, “Player Kim Hyukjin, what is your current level?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought for a moment. Should I tell her, or not? There were advantages to both options. I decided to tell her, for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Level 8.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia’s wingtips trembled again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no mistake that you’re level 8?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can scan me if you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia stared at me in disbelief for a while. After a long moment, she opened her mouth again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You really are level 8.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t show it, but she seemed shocked. There was no doubt; My leveling speed was out of the ordinary. It wasn’t just my imagination.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After checking my level, Senia returned to her usual half-transparent state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘My leveling speed must definitely be really damn fast.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa and I hunted a little longer in the vicinity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My EXP rose until I was on the verge of hitting level 9. In the Tutorial Arena, the max level was 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Soon, I’ll be level 9.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to stop hunting now. After all, my objective was the ‘D-Tower’. More specifically, the 1st floor of the D-Tower. If I could clear that floor well, I would gain a ton of bonuses and pretty much become the face of Players worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If I can just do that part well…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning $1 million afterwards would be no problem, even if I were an early bloomer. Sunhwa and I arrived at the D-Tower. There were multiple entrances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This one.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chose the one without monsters. I heard a notice.</span></p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘YES.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I selected yes. The revolving door began to slowly move, as if inviting me to come inside. Sunhwa clutched a part of my clothes behind me, a little scared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You remember what we have to do when we’re inside, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa’s voice trembled a little. I knew that, but I didn’t show it on my face, because although Sunhwa wasn’t trying to act spoiled, I had no intention of humoring her, even if she was. For a brief moment, I checked my stats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was completely different from other level 8s in my memory. It gave me confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went ahead first. The half-transparent Senia followed me.</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 8: D-Tower 1st Floor</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 1st floor of the D-Tower, I could see the escalator going to the second floor and a few ‘City Foxes’ and ‘Goblins’ nearby. It might be a Tutorial, but a dungeon was a dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ll be at least one level higher than the monsters outside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">City Fox LVL 4</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Foxes and Goblins were 1-2 levels higher. Some were even 3 levels higher.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goblin LVL 8</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I had arranged in advance, I disbanded the party with Sunhwa. In other words, we weren’t sharing EXP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Start with all the Goblins you can see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn’t touch the foxes, they wouldn’t turn hostile. In higher level dungeons, all the monsters were hostile. But this was the Tutorial Dungeon. This Tutorial might not seem like a tutorial at all, but there was no denying it was easier than a higher level dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa did way better than I expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘As expected… must be the effect of the talent.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when she was scared shitless by a baby Goblin, but after just four days together, Sunhwa was hunting adult Goblins just fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s killing them well, even though she’s only level 6.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A level 6 Player was making quick work of a level 8 Goblin. This had to be the effect of talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take a break after taking care of that Goblin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa got rid of the last remaining Goblin. For reference, the item she had equipped was ‘Worn Iron Gauntlets’. Sunhwa clobbered the Goblin with her fists, all while precisely striking the weak point I’d told her about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s doing really well.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins’ attacks didn’t register on Sunhwa at all, almost as if she had some kind of special skill or special constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to me, she asked, “Did I do well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nope. Did you think so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa shook her head. “I think I’m way worse compared to you, oppa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huh. ‘Actually, that’s true, isn’t it?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, the Playing of this child I considered a genius didn’t look all that impressive to me. Was it because she was young or because I was underestimating her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But why am </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so good at this?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know why. In any case, there was no mistake—so far, I was Playing even better than Sunhwa. So much so that I had the very rational question of ‘Am I a genius?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The miniboss will spawn soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The miniboss, the ‘Goblin Soldier’, would soon appear. The Goblin Soldier’s level would be displayed as ‘?’, as it would be a much higher level than me. The estimated level was roughly 13. Mine was currently 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can do this.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was already proven through countless clears. I had seen the VR dungeon Play many times. Of course, that was an artificial VR dungeon based on the recollections of the ‘Fist King So Yoohyun’ and other survivors, but clearing the 1st floor </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible from level 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to be level 8 for it to be possible.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hunting all of the Goblins and City Foxes here, the miniboss, the ‘Goblin Soldier’, would spawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good to go again, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I think I’ve recovered my stamina as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then catch the rest of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the rest were killed, the ‘Goblin Soldier’ would appear, and we would form the party again before that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Run back here right away afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, near the ATM. I reminded her again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa carried out my orders to a T. She killed the rest of the monsters, and in doing so, she hit level 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa, I got them all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know. Run back here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa ran over, and the two of us hid ourselves behind the ATM on the 1st floor. We were squeezed in together as much as possible. It was a good thing Sunhwa had a small build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said quietly, “Lower your head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the entirety of the field momentarily turned grey, almost like someone had pressed the pause button in a game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Isn’t this a Pause?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermediate Administrators could briefly suspend a field with their individual authorities or with an ‘item’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But this item costs a pretty penny.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know exactly how much, but I heard you had to invest quite a lot of Coins in it. It was a kind of power used by Streamers when they wanted to interfere with a Player, during which the video transmission to the Guardians was turned off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A Pause has taken effect.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ expresses intense curiosity.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Courageous Lion King’ has begun to take an interest again.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Anonymous Guardians have begun to clamor.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Player Kim Hyukjin. Are you in your right mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia stared at me expressionlessly. Her eyes lacked emotion, but they were rather intense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have acted as if you know everything. Is this situation also one that you have intended?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know what kind of ability you have, but if you have such a power, why in the world are you doing such a foolish thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Again, what do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After staring at me for a moment, Senia slowly continued. “The Goblin Soldier is level 13. It’s also receiving a boss monster stat buff. It is not a creature you can defeat right now. Much less with only two people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the heck? Was this woman always so talkative?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you’re saying you would rather not see me die, hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason was obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Because I’m a Player who can provide the material to create a hit.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because I made good quality content. If I had to guess, I had to be the person carrying out the most unique Playing out of the countless Players out there, unless there was another regressor who had memorized every Play by heart like I had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Player like me was material, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">content</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that a Streamer would be hard-pressed to find again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, Senia. Your way of talking is insufferable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; Are you insulting me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me give you a tip.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew about the Streamers of the future. I knew about many Intermediate Administrators, as well as many Streamers on Youtube. I knew how they ticked, and even had a rough understanding of how to become a famous Streamer. An expressionless Streamer who spoke with this little eloquence and only had looks going for her wouldn’t be able to survive the fierce competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the pause ends, make a big fuss. No, wait. Making a fuss would be difficult with your personality. Just explain that it’s a monster I could never possibly catch. That’s the truth, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was going slightly off-topic, but Senia was truly beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that the thought periodically invaded my mind despite not being the time or place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If she wasn’t able to become famous later despite being this beautiful…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It meant she had been eliminated, unable to survive the competition between the Streamers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do some directing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia continued to stare at me with the same expressionless face as before. She didn’t respond, but seeing as her wingtips were trembling, it did seem that my words had caused a ripple in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I’ll successfully kill the monster without dying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You… will kill the Goblin Soldier?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. The Goblin Soldier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are incapable of doing so. It is impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So watch. Watch how I kill it. Isn’t it some great hit material? A real scrub of a Player destroying a frickin’ Tutorial Dungeon miniboss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more Guardians watching, the better. Famous Streamers were sure to attract famous Guardians, because such Guardians were unstinting in their support to Streamers and Players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make a deal with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could say anything, Senia quickly interjected. “Player Kim Hyukjin. Your impudence has gone too far. You are level 8. There is a limit to how much disrespect I can tolerate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, an Intermediate Administrator was an Intermediate Administrator, through and through. She was someone who could kill me anytime for any offense. Unless it was related to the ‘Commandments’, it was no big issue for an Administrator to kill me. She could have probably split my body into two with a single lift of her finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, “If you had wanted to kill me, you would have done so already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you even used your Pause power to stop me, didn’t you? Could you really bear to kill me? Isn’t that power very expensive?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia’s wingtips trembled once again. I was sure of it. This woman might be a skilled Administrator, but she was an inept talker. She must have been eliminated from the Streamer competition because she was so inarticulate and only had a pretty face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I, a level 8 Player with no real skills, will defeat the miniboss. The Guardians might even strip naked in utter excitement. And you could instantly become an Administrator producing quality content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a loss for you, am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Senia asked, “What are your trade conditions?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For now, what do you think about discussing it after I kill the miniboss? I think the pause time is almost over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time since meeting me, Senia betrayed a small frown on her face. For the first time since meeting me, there was a change in her expression. It was as if she were asking, ‘How in the world do you know all of this?’ Naturally, I wouldn’t answer her question, and there was no need to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. I will watch. Keep this in mind. The Goblin Soldier… is something you could never defeat with your current power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that instant, the ‘Pause’ ended. The monochrome world returned to normal, the momentarily paused time beginning to tick once more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[All of the field’s monsters have been eliminated.]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s coming.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I was next to the ATM, crouching there with Sunhwa halfway in my arms. Cold sweat ran down my back. I spoke confidently to Senia, but couldn’t help but be nervous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Goblin Soldier’ has spawned.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The miniboss, the Goblin Soldier, appeared. Soon, it would look around, seeing corpses in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’ll be enraged.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I was right.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The miniboss ‘Goblin Soldier’ expresses its rage.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, the enraged Goblin Soldier would use its most threatening attack as soon as it appeared. Spear Throw—its most dangerous ability. That was an attack I couldn’t take on with my current abilities, an attack that would instantly kill me if it hit me full-on.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikikik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Soldier’s scream made a shiver run down my spine.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwip–!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a whistle in the air. It was hard to put it in words, but it felt like something terrifying was approaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s coming.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thud!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rang out as the Goblin Soldier’s spear punched through the ATM. Something sharp was protruding a bit a little above where I was crouching.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drip.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweat ran down my brow. I’d only seen the clears; doing it in person was incredibly spine-tingling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘First hurdle, done.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Soldier’s most threatening attack was neutralized. The very moment it appeared, it would fiercely hurl a spear towards the Players. This attack was the most terrifying one, which was why we hid, using the ATM as a shield.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t able to pay attention to the notices. ‘Hiding next to the ATM was the most effective move in the clears.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Player moved elsewhere, the Goblin Soldier would move as well, coming closer and then throwing its spear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is the perfect distance for making that bastard throw its spear without moving.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place that could also provide cover at the same time was next to the ATM. This hunting spot, determined to be the optimum location through VR dungeons, was the perfect place for blocking the most dangerous attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I snuck a glance at the half-transparent Senia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Watch carefully.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch how a lousy level 8 Player kills a miniboss monster.</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 9: D-Tower 1st Floor (2)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa trembled like a leaf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I-It went through the ATM.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spear stuck out from the ATM. What would have happened if she had taken such a hit face-on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I-I would have been skewered.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She might have died in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How is he planning on catching such a monster?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was scared. She wanted to turn and flee, right now. She wanted to cry, but she resisted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have to be helpful.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, she could be abandoned, and she didn’t want that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll be back after just 100 days and nights. Promise. You’ll be good, won’t you, my daughter?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mom abandoned her with those words. After 100 days passed, 200, even 300, her mom didn’t come back. When Sunhwa turned ten, she realized then that she had been abandoned. She was abandoned by her mom and grew up in the orphanage. That feeling… She hated and feared it so much. Even more than the Goblin Soldier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She reviewed each and every thing Kim Hyukjin had said, balling her fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can do this!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa jumped out from behind the ATM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Just like what oppa said.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Kim Hyukjin said, the monsters in the vicinity had been revived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taunt!”</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[Using the skill Taunt.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa used her skill, ‘Taunt’, and ‘!!!’ marks appeared over the heads of the City Foxes and Goblins that had been revived with the appearance of the miniboss monster. It was an indication that she had properly drawn their aggro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have to do well.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some distance away, she saw a Goblin around 180 centimetres in size, far bigger and bulkier in appearance than regular Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Because oppa is facing that monster.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monsters rushed in. But she wasn’t scared. She already knew from experience that even if they bit, attacked, and struck her, it wouldn’t hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting as little force as possible in her fists, she hit the Goblins and City Foxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That’s enough. I have to stop here.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HP of the monsters had been reduced to around 10%. Keeping them at that level, Sunhwa waited, periodically using ‘Taunt’ to keep that ‘!!!’ over their heads. Surrounded by monsters, Sunhwa stared at Kim Hyukjin. He was panting hard, looking exhausted to the point of collapsing at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Please…!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa put her hands together and prayed. She prayed they would be able to survive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin caught his breath, thinking, ‘The feeling of pressure is insane.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was bigger than an average adult man. With a little exaggeration, even the muscles were like Hulk’s. It was nothing compared to the monster on the 2nd Floor, but right now, it looked extremely imposing to him. He thought he had grown rather used to that existence called a ‘monster’, but this monster overturned those thoughts. It was getting a miniboss stat buff, but still, he was floored by the power of a level 13 monster. He couldn’t even imagine how intimidating high level bosses would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The thing I have to watch out for is that spear attack.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a high level monster. It was different from a regular level 13 because of the inherent boss mob stat buff, but it still had a very simple attack pattern. A stabbing attack, and a swing from top to bottom. Those were the only two attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘Goblin Soldier’ quickly closed in on Hyukjin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Here it comes!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyukjin gripped the Rusted Iron Sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Will he stab, or will he swing?’ He raised his focus to the max. ‘It’s a swing.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He saw it. He saw that the Goblin Soldier was preparing to swing its spear from top to bottom. He evaded slightly to the side, rushing towards the Goblin and swinging the Rusted Iron Sword at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sliced at the Goblin Soldier’s side. But because his attack power was too low, he wasn’t able to deal an effective blow. It only served to enrage the Goblin Soldier.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikikikik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a sound far louder than a regular Goblin, the miniboss swung its spear down on Hyukjin, at a speed that looked extremely fast in Hyukjin’s eyes. It was fast, but not unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin swung his iron sword to deftly parry the Goblin Soldier’s strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The half-transparent Senia focused on that scene. She could see the Guardians making a huge fuss.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[Anonymous Guardians are joining Channel #19207 in large numbers.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia almost smiled for the first time ever. They didn’t reveal their ‘True Names’, but the Guardians joined her channel all the same. Her boring, unpopular channel. However, she did not smile. Ever since she was a child, she had been taught that ‘the act of showing one’s emotions’ was vulgar. She did become an Intermediate Administrator, but she jumped into this job determined not to become vulgar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various anonymous Guardians peppered her with questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Are you sure he’s really level 8?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–A level 8 Player is truly raiding the Tutorial Dungeon’s miniboss?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia nodded to show her assent. It was true. He avoided the ‘Initial Strike’ that would cause certain death to a level 8 Player by cleverly using some cover and was fighting the Goblin Soldier. It was unbelievable, but that was the truth. She had never seen a Player like him in any dimension before, at least not in the Tutorial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wondered what kind of stats he must have to be able to execute such movements. The anonymous Guardians, aka the ‘rabble’, were clamoring in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Those aren’t the movements of a level 8 though?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–How can a level 8 move in that manner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–He didn’t lie about his level?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rabble fussed to their content, and the Guardians who had revealed their ‘True Names’ were keeping an eye on the situation, their eyes glued to the level 8 Player’s incredible Playing. Senia was the same. At this point, even Senia was curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another Player without much presence caught her eyes. Her name was Kang Sunhwa, an Awakened of the tanker class. She stood still, surrounded by monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Kim Hyukjin yelled, looking so incredibly exhausted it seemed he could faint at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now! Kill them!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia instantly realized what Kim Hyukjin was trying to do. Sunhwa killed the City Foxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone in the same party as Kang Sunhwa, Kim Hyukjin’s level went up.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the level up, his condition recovered. Hyukjin felt refreshed. Moments ago, he was gasping for breath and felt like he could drop dead from exhaustion, but now, he was fine. He purposely timed and planned his EXP like this, so he could level up when needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take the monsters and get some distance between us. The monsters will keep reviving, so kill as many as you can, until I give you the signal to stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, I engaged with the Goblin Soldier again. Now level 9, I was a little stronger, and a little more used to the Goblin Soldier. Our battle went on for a long thirty minutes. I stuck to the Goblin Soldier like a burr, avoiding critical injuries and occasionally attacking. Time and time again, I aimed for the nape, the common weakness of all Goblins.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikik! Kikikikikik!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enraged by the annoyance before it, the Goblin Soldier once again swung its spear from top to bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finished my instantaneous calculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’ll let that one hit me.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to sacrifice my left shoulder. I would use my shoulder to aim for the miniboss’ throat, all for the chance of inflicting a deeper blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Argh!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spear plunged into my shoulder. A shoulder-rending agony assailed me, but I held on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And strike.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I timed it to the millisecond. For that moment, and that moment alone, I forgot I was someone judged to have [No Talent]. It felt as if everything were clear in my eyes, and my entire being was focused on this situation alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With exactly the right timing, I surged towards the Goblin Soldier. Right at the moment Sunhwa killed a City Fox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Level increased.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Current level: 10]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain disappeared, and my body returned to normal. I was aiming for this moment. Vigor circulated throughout my entire body as I jabbed the Rusted Iron Sword at the Goblin Soldier’s neck before immediately getting behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can see it!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw the weak spot on the back of the neck, a black dot. That dot seemed large in my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thrust the Rusted Iron Sword in with all my strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is it over?’’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment:</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The Rusted Iron Sword has been destroyed.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had reached the end of its durability. As the sword was destroyed, the Goblin Soldier’s body began to tip forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s over.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally killed it. The miniboss, the Goblin Soldier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless notices flooded in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then:</span></p>

<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was instantly stunned into speechlessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can level up?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tutorial Field was capped at level 10. But that level restriction was lifted, and I even fulfilled a ‘Hidden Piece qualification condition’. I didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t all. Senia swiftly snagged the body of the Goblin Soldier, and a yellow light radiated from the Goblin Soldier’s body before disappearing. Then, she approached me and handed something to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the reward item for hunting the miniboss.”</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[‘Iron Sword’ acquired as a reward.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was given an ‘Iron Sword’ to replace the ‘Rusted Iron Sword’. It had twice the attack power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sound rang in my head.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The Intermediate Administrator Senia has requested a private chat. Will you accept? Y/N]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia seemed rather surprised, too, seeing as she blatantly asked for a private chat. This conversation wouldn’t be heard by the Guardians. Sunhwa wouldn’t hear it, either. It was a conversation between Player and Intermediate Administrator, just the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Accept.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia asked me a question expressionlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Did you hunt the miniboss by timing the level up precisely? All while managing your stamina?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–I told you I would show you. I’d show you me killing the miniboss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–It was not a Play that someone of your level could show. Do you have a True Name?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A True Name? What in the world was that? I certainly didn’t have anything like that. All I knew was the strategy from the future. However, I didn’t go out of my way to correct her misunderstanding. Even though I didn’t know what a True Name was, there was no big need for me to correct her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Don’t forget that you agreed to make a deal with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was it talent? Was it luck? Or was it something else? I thought I could hear Senia’s voice, but then the private chat ended.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ is awed by your shocking ability to concentrate.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The level 10 cap has been lifted from the Tutorial Field. I also got a new item and even drew admiration from a Guardian.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did… I really have [No Talent]? I realized while fighting the Goblin Soldier, but there was no way I was talentless. On the contrary, my talent was immense. I didn’t know what my limits were, but for now, according to what I knew, I had a level of talent unprecedented in the history of the past. It was a bit embarrassing for me to say it, but I ended up wondering if this level of talent was close to ‘transcendent’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I even got a sponsorship.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t notice it before, because I was focusing so intensely, but I had received a ‘sponsorship.’ It was probably an unprecedented record in the Tutorial Field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very, no, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, smooth start. Under the assumption that I didn’t go up to ‘Floor 2’, at least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the notices didn’t stop there.</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 10: The Tutorial’s Hidden Piece</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Lady of the Scales’ has begun to watch you with interest.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I flinched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The Lady of the Scales?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her name alone wasn’t all that impressive. But I was already well-aware of what kind of Guardian the ‘Lady of the Scales’ was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s the Guardian of the Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was one of the 8 Players who represented Korea, and she was a Guardian who prioritized ‘fairness’ above all and liked Players capable of ‘doing acts of good’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Her personality is close to lawful good.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the ‘Courageous Lion King’, who could care less about whether his sponsored Players died or not, the ‘Lady of the Scales’ was a stern upholder of justice and prioritized the wellbeing of her Players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She also gives appropriate compensation, and is one of the Guardians who gives extremely reliable support.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the Lady of the Scales had me in her sights was nothing but welcomed news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Fairness, justice, sacrifice, and commitment. The Lady of the Scales is a Guardian who reacts primarily to such things.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced at Sunhwa behind me. It was commonly said that the Guardians were looking down ‘from above’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘From up there, it must have looked like I was protecting Sunhwa.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was my best guess. In any case, it was good. Someone who was told they had [No Talent] like me already had the interest of three Guardians, and the fact I had secured myself a special privilege meant I had made huge strides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa, what do we do now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My previous plans changed a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Originally… we were going to leave and hide in the nearby Safety Zone, waiting for the Fist King So Yoohyun to come and kill that thing on the 2nd floor, but…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After killing the Goblin Soldier on the 1st floor, large-scale onslaughts like the Goblin attack would end. That meant safety would be pretty much guaranteed afterwards. That’s why I rushed to kill the Goblin Soldier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘For now, we’re safe.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I killed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that guy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the 2nd floor of the D-Tower, I would get the title of ‘Tutorial Ender’, but I didn’t hope for that much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Let’s make full use of the Tutorial Field’s special characteristics.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I zeroed in on my goal, a goal right in front of my eyes. I would earn $1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And then…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I wanted to look further ahead. Like anyone else, I wanted to succeed and live well. I wanted to live happily with my family and do everything I wanted. It was too early to jump to conclusions, but currently, I suspected that my talent was very nearly ‘transcendent’. And I… didn’t want to let a talent like this go to waste. I no longer wanted to be a burden on my family and study for ages to become a civil servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to Sunhwa, I said, “We’re going to go hunt the monsters outside the D-Tower. As many as we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The City Foxes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we went a bit towards the Cheonggyecheon district, we would run into ‘City Wolves’ instead of ‘City Foxes’. They were pack monsters that were far more ferocious. Even so, they were only slightly higher in level than Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their levels are around 7. They sometimes have alphas, and those guys are around level 9. The two of us can hunt them no problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where did you learn that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa didn’t harbor any suspicion. Her eyes showed absolute trust in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I purposefully didn’t continue to press Senia about the ‘deal’. She hadn’t mentioned it. I gave a thin smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Alright then, let’s dance. Push and pull.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this dance of pushing and pulling, it wasn’t a bad thing to see who would end up on top—the Streamer who had absolutely nothing going for her besides her appearance vs. the regressor whose future was shining brightly? It was painfully obvious who had the upper hand, so I wasn’t in a rush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The person who gets impatient first loses.’</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awoooooooo–!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Wolves called their comrades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taunt!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a single wolf slipped past, all of them charging straight for Sunhwa, and in the meantime, I defeated the wolves from behind. After a few fights, it seemed that ‘club’-type weapons were more effective than ‘bladed’ ones, so I hunted them using the ‘Wooden Club’ that dropped from the wolves.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hunting for about one hour, we rested in a nearby convenience store before continuing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, my level went up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I really did become level 11.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I broke the level cap of 10. That it was at all possible to reach level 11 in the Tutorial Field was something that even I, a rote memorizer of the Ten Years’ History, hadn’t known at all. I guessed even the Fist King So Yoohyun didn’t know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notices continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Congratulations!]</span></p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could only doubt my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A title?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were ‘titles’ in the System. The abilities of Players could vary immensely due to titles. It could be called a benefit that bestowed special parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s a title in the Tutorial Field? Other than Tutorial Ender?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d never heard or seen of such a thing. A ‘title’ could only be gained at around level 30, and even then it wasn’t guaranteed. I killed the Tutorial Field’s miniboss monster, the ‘Goblin Soldier’, and still didn’t get a title. So I was stunned I got a title just by reaching level 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you get a title?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God, she scared me. Senia suddenly appeared behind me. Though her face was expressionless, the tips of her wings were trembling. The Guardians might even be clamoring “Tell us what kind of title he got! Find that out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did get a title.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of title?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia asked with an impressive nonchalance, but her expression was extremely stiff. She’d always had an expressionless face, but right now, it was looking kind of robotic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not telling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Player didn’t want to disclose, they had no obligation to. Titles couldn’t even be scanned. I decided to check it out first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had fallen into a daze without realizing it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ is terribly curious about your reward.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like the Guardians had no idea what I had just received. There was no need to expose everything to the Guardians. I had to hide an appropriate amount, choosing and picking what I would reveal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can’t believe it’s a 20% buff to EXP.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A boost that big made it a title of the highest level. In particular, an experience buff in the beginning would have a huge butterfly effect that would aid me later, because it would help me get firsts in everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If I can keep developing like this…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could really become a Ranker. Wealth. Glory. Power. All of those things could become mine. And even if it wasn’t as grand as those things, I could definitely succeed enough to feed and clothe my family very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before, in order to succeed, the only option was to study like all the others to become a civil servant. But now, it was different. I could forge a different path from the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said to Sunhwa, “Let’s keep hunting. We’ll level up for another two days or so.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiya!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoohyun punched.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arf!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoohyun rubbed his nose. The people behind him cheered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In one hit again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is he, One Punch Man?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even a level 8 monster is no big deal, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Wolves were wolves in name, but they seemed weaker than stray mutts. So Yoohyun had realized many things over the last five days. He leveled up faster than others. He was stronger than others. He didn’t know why, but it was true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were hardly any monsters that could survive his one and only skill, ‘Power Fist’. As a result, quite a lot of people trailed behind So Yoohyun. Those people thought they’d grabbed a real lifeline. Roughly ten people were following him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re indeed incredible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. So Yoohyun is the strongest on the Tutorial Field, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pshaw. I’m not that great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone could see it. Even though he was saying ‘not at all!’ and acting humble, So Yoohyun’s earlobes were a bit red. He was definitely a bit embarrassed right now. At first sight, he looked like a regular ol’ moron, but his body was quivering with muscles that were anything but ordinary. However, at that moment, So Yoohyun saw someone in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the vicinity of Cheonggyecheon, where they were, he saw another team hunting ‘City Wolves’, made up of a young man and girl. The child was taking the tanker role, while the man was handling the DPS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are more survivors!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun swiftly strode that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having just finished hunting the City Wolves, Kim Hyukjin stared at So Yoohyun. He was able to recognize the man instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The Fist King’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the Fist King So Yoohyun. Hyukjin was meeting him in person. Many people were following So Yoohyun—it seemed he had rescued them all, unlike Hyukjin, who had turned away many people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can’t believe I’m seeing the Fist King in person.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was one of the eight most famous Players in Korea. He looked to be about 190 centimetres tall and had a very bulky physique, but his eyes looked very honest and simple. The dark circles under his eyes gave him a big panda image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short conversation, So Yoohyun made a proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you like to work with us? Survivors should clump together, right? What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin looked So Yoohyun straight in the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If everything goes the way I saw in the past…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the people behind him would die. The only person who survived hunting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that thing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the 2nd floor of Gwanghwamun D-Tower was So Yoohyun. According to So Yoohyun’s reminiscing, he said the thing he regretted most was taking those people to the 2nd floor of D-Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyukjin refused So Yoohyun’s offer. He had no intention of hunting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that thing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was far more dangerous than the Goblin Soldier, and there was a high chance he would die. This was such a rare chance. He couldn’t let it go to waste in vain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing, Hyukjin said, “I heard the Tutorial Field will end after surviving for seven days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His #1 goal was to earn $1 million, and for that reason, he had to survive the Tutorial Field. There was no need to face excessive danger in order to defeat the Tutorial Field’s boss monster. The moment he killed the Goblin Soldier, the ‘attacks’ or ‘waves’ ceased for good, which meant there was absolutely no need to flirt with death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mm. No helping it then,” said So Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoohyun didn’t dwell on it or insist. His personality had always been like that. No matter what happened, he simply accepted it for what it was. However, the people following him thought that Kim Hyukjin was a little rude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He must not know So Yoohyun’s strength yet…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Tsk, tsk. He just kicked away a good offer with his own two feet.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like the pair was pretty skilled themselves, but they didn’t think they had anything on So Yoohyun, who had the power to kill a City Wolf in one hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Can’t be helped. He’s simply throwing away his own fortune.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn’t openly show their discomfort on their faces, but it was palpable to Kim Hyukjin. He said, “Survive. I wish you good fortune. If you meet a truly powerful monster and are in a truly hopeless situation… Aim for the left eye.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun would walk his path, and he would walk his. He just had to think about how to get out of here in one piece. History would continue on its path. And within that prescribed path, Kim Hyukjin would secure as much profit as he could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He continued to hunt wolf packs.</span></p>

Even though he was killing ‘City Wolves’ that were relatively weak, his EXP was going up nicely. As time went on, he learned some tricks to hunting and was able to hunt faster than the wolves respawned. </span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 11: The Tutorial’s Hidden Piece (2)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[You have fulfilled the conditions for the Hidden Piece.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was there always a Hidden Piece in the Tutorial Field? Not that I was aware of. Even the man who had taken the lead in clearing the Tutorial Field, So Yoohyun, hadn’t said anything about a Hidden Piece, nor had any other survivor. In other words, I was the first person to discover it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s not necessarily something to be happy about.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hidden Piece reward was sure to be big. But it came with just as much liability for risk. Moreover, this ‘Hidden Piece’ wasn’t something I knew about, so it was an unknown risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notices continued.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The King of the Wolves, a Lycanthrope, has appeared.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I urgently yanked Sunhwa’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sunhwa. Run!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa was taken aback, but she nodded, starting to run, as if determined not to lose track of me.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The King of the Wolves, a Lycanthrope, is enraged.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bodies of ‘City Wolves’ were littered all around it. That was probably the reason for the Lycanthrope’s rage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why is a Lycanthrope showing up in a Tutorial Field?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope, simply put, was a humanoid wolf that ran around on two feet. Its level was normally around the 20~25 range. It wasn’t a monster that should appear in the Tutorial. In terms of just physical ability, it was toe-to-toe with the monster on the 2nd floor of the D-Tower. Actually, just looking at the attack power, there was a chance it was even more powerful than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">him.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Dammit.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just Sunhwa and I, we couldn’t defeat the Lycanthrope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sunhwa. You hide behind that car over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pushed Sunhwa away, eyeing the distance. Whether it was survival instinct or a rational thought process doing whatever it had to do to survive, I couldn’t say. I finished making my decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s all or nothing.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope was fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In any case, I can’t run.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope was already looking this way, meaning it had already targeted us. Even if I ran with all my might, I would probably be caught in five seconds. Hiding behind the car I pointed out, Sunhwa trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Sunhwa won’t be able to defend herself from the attack of an animal-type monster over level 20 yet.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope’s teeth and claws were sharp, incomparable to the knives of a baby Goblin. I took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your heartbeat is rising excessively.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calm Observer’s Eye kicked in as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Control the mind.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay calm, I urged myself. I took in another big breath, then used one of the items in my Inventory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of the High Strength Elixir was like 3 level ups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come at me, you shitty dog!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t defeat it with the High Strength Elixir alone. I was well aware of that, but it wasn’t as if the situation was completely hopeless.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A distance away, Kang Sunhwa could only watch the wolf-human through the car window in horror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s so different.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much that it felt like a creature in a completely different dimension from all the other monsters she had seen so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">Lycanthrope LVL?</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She clearly saw red letters above the Lycanthrope’s head. Even its name looked extremely dangerous. It was like the System was screaming at her that he was a monster she couldn’t yet face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Oppa…!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t have a clue about what he was planning to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I beg you. I beg you, God. Please, help us.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though her mom had abandoned her and run away, Sunhwa still wanted to see her. She wanted to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’ll be good. I’ll study hard.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just then, she heard Kim Hyukjin yell something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come at me, you shitty dog!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if the sky darkened. Whatever oppa was thinking, that shout at least succeeded spectacularly in irritating the Lycanthrope more than any effect of Sunhwa’s ‘Taunt’ skill could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awoooooooo–!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope howled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa fell to her knees with a thump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She trembled, and her teeth clattered together, completely at the mercy of the Lycanthrope’s howl. The Lycanthrope went from two legs to all four and began to run like a wolf.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s too fast!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2-meter large, muscular monster sprang forward, instantaneously drawing near. I felt sweat run down my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How can it be so fast despite being so big?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had seen it often on Youtube, but seeing it on the screen and experiencing it in person were two different things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I counted in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘3.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope was right in front of me, just five meters away, a distance so short it could be traversed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘2.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope’s golden eyes glowed brightly. They were the eyes of a predator eyeing its prey, and those glowing orbs were fixed directly on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘1.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I clenched my fists hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope jumped into the air. I instantly rolled forward, just one rotation. I only imagined the movement, but my body followed through more fluidly than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Lycanthrope was high in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Its first attack is always a jump.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made use of that habit. A few seconds was a short period, but I used every second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And then—’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if planning on making use of explosive strength, the Lycanthrope’s leg muscles expanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw it all in my mind. The Lycanthrope would shoot forward towards me as soon as it landed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out the item in my Inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Aim for where those feet shadows are forming.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My eyes flicked towards that spot, every movement as natural as if I had experienced and learned all of this before. Then, I raised the reward I had coerced from Senia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Quality Lubricant]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good quality lubrication oil. It can sharpen the blade of an item with an edge, or be applied to a part that requires lubrication.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I splashed the lubricant on the ground, and in the very next moment, the Lycanthrope landed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I threw myself at the Lycanthrope, pushing the beast with all of my strength.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sliiiide!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It slid backwards, losing its balance, and fell into the Cheonggyecheon River.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I-I did it!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the Cheonggyecheon district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’s in.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Lycanthrope fell into the river flowing through it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aroo?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lycanthrope proceeded to produce sounds that didn’t match its threatening aura, yelping like a drowning puppy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘Great Explorer Jackson’ said the following about this method: “Any low-level Players who attempt this method might need to be prepared to lose their life. However, this is also the only method that would, if successfully done, allow a low-level Player to kill a Lycanthrope.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It really worked?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only method available to me was to dunk the Lycanthrope into water. Method aside, I successfully achieved that. It had only been made possible by the geographical location, Cheonggyecheon, the ‘Quality Lubricant’ item, and perfect timing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I really… did it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was simply unbelievable. Even I, myself, was stunned. I carried it out on the small possibility it might work, but it actually did. In all actuality, a war between logic and instinct had raged within me just now. My logic said, ‘You’ll never win’, but my instinct said, ‘You can win’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It was definitely dangerous, but…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangely enough…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It was easier than expected.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you broke it down, drowning the Lycanthrope was absolutely not easy to do. Everything had to line up perfectly in order for it to work. Even a well-trained Player would be hard-pressed to break the Lycanthrope’s balance and push it into the river with such precise timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between my logic and instinct was simply too big. Strangely, it felt far too easy compared to the difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Oppa. Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa approached me, looking down upon hearing the yelping from the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-Is that the Lycanthrope?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lycanthrope LVL?</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was indeed the Lycanthrope, but it had become so much smaller, smaller than a City Wolf. It was like a puppy. I walked down the bank and killed the Lycanthrope as easily as if I were facing a City Wolf. Weakened and turned tiny by the water, the Lycanthrope was a breeze to kill, and I finished it off with his Iron Sword. It couldn’t even move, much less resist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I really killed it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I killed a Lycanthrope, a monster over twice my level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I saw it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything had played out before me, showing me exactly how I should move. It was as natural as if someone were showing me, as natural as breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After killing it, I was absolutely certain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m sure of it. This is the influence of talent.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talent, that innate value that one was born with and could not be attained by any amount of effort. I had it, although I still couldn’t rule out the possibility that I might be an early bloomer Player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In any case, I survived.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had certainly escaped the jaws of death. Sunhwa came closer and expressed her admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa. You didn’t do any kind of martial arts before, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t had time for something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was like a movie or something. How did you pull that off?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did I look a bit cool?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not just a bit, a lot cool.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa looked more excited than the person who dealt the finishing blow. She was like, “You went whee” and then “kasham” and then “whoosh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is reality.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a dream. I, an eternal civil servant student, killed a Lycanthrope. With my own two hands. My level instantly went up.</span></p>

<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The ‘Courageous Lion King snorts in disdain at your cowardly tricks.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant the jerk was still in Senia’s channel. I laughed inwardly. It looked like the Courageous Lion King was still gawking at me. However, the notices of other Guardians came in as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—the Lady of the Scales sent in 700 Coins. By spirit of sacrifice, she probably was referring to how it ended up looking like I protected Sunhwa with my life on the line. It was a bit off the mark, but who cared? As long as the result was good, it was fine. In any case, I acquired 1,900 Coins in a matter of moments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘1900 Coins…!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Tutorial was still underway. Before the battle, I was only level 13 and had about 6,000 Coins. But with the gifts from the Guardians, I got a lump sum of 1,900 Coins in one fell swoop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Which means, my Coins amount to…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I booted up my Inventory Window and looked at the number at the very bottom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[Held Coins: 7,942]</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had earned nearly 8,000 Coins, and all in the Tutorial. I was now level 15, with almost eight grand in Coins. I achieved something that no theory or strategy ten years in the future had ever imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Plus.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t all. Something truly important was next. </span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: D-Tower 2nd Floor</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Level 15.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From level 15 onwards, it was possible to use the ‘Item Shop’. Sure enough, I got a notice telling me that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You can now use the Item Shop.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Item Shop is Tutorial-Grade.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Tutorial-Grade Item Shop can be used through an ‘Intermediate Administrator’.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermediate Administrator was System lingo for what we called Streamer, so Senia. She had been continuously trailing me, observing me the whole time, just as I wanted. It was because I made for pretty great quality material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia appeared, seemingly knowing why I called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will give you an explanation of the Item Shop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the Shop hadn’t been opened in the Tutorial, so even though I was already very familiar with it, I decided to listen to Senia’s explanation anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are currently in the Tutorial Field. The Item Shop’s grade has been set to ‘Tutorial’, and as such, only four items can be purchased.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn’t anything all that special in her explanation. I opened up the Item Shop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Item Shop &#8211; Tutorial-Grade]</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low Constitution Potion</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">100 Coins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low Mana Potion</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">100 Coins</span></li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Senia said, the Tutorial-grade Item Shop had a lot of limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There are only four things I can buy, but…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Tutorial, this was already plenty. Plus, I had 8,000 Coins in my possession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ask Player Kim Hyukjin once again. Do you really not have a True Name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t need to know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t even know what a True Name was. At my response, Senia’s wings trembled again. She was as expressionless as ever, but when she spoke to me again, her voice was at least half a pitch higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not very curious about it either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like she was lying through her teeth and was actually very curious, but I didn’t pay much attention to her. I looked once again in the direction the Fist King, So Yoohyun, and the others had gone. At the end of that path was the D-Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If I have these…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the potions, it was doable. I didn’t have to use the level up trick like I did when hunting the miniboss, the Goblin Soldier, because I could definitely handle it by using the Constitution and Cure Potions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Player Kim Hyukjin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You haven’t checked the Excellent Hunter title.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could only be one reason why she was saying such a thing. She wanted to make it public to the Guardians. She wanted to tell them the Player she was broadcasting earned this and that kind of title, by doing A, B, C.  I was sure the Guardians were also on the edge of their seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I’ll check it now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will you check the Excellent Hunter title?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I’ll do it on my own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia’s face was as flat as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t look so happy? Did you think I would open up a public window and let you take a look?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As I have emphasized time and time again, I am not curious about you in the least.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying so, Senia returned to her opaque state, as if to say she wouldn’t meddle with me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s a total newb.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw how cleverly the Streamers handled Rankers ten years later, and in my eyes, Senia seemed like a true beginner of beginners. In other words…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s easy for me to handle.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was good for me. To become an ‘amazing Player’, it would be best not to publicize my information to the Guardians too much. It was most advantageous for the Player to maintain a certain level of mystery. That would stimulate the curiosity of the Guardians, and it was my job right now to slowly sate their desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Let’s see here.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of title did I get from killing the Hidden Monster, a Lycanthrope, that appeared on the Hidden Field? Normally, it was an impossible monster for someone of my level to hunt. I turned my attention to checking what kind of reward I had received from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Check.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the title description.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excellent Hunter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special title only given on the Tutorial Field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applies only to creatures recognized by the System as ‘non-sentient beings’.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% additional damage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">+10% movement speed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to use the skill ‘Hunter’s Strike’—a low chance to ignore the prey’s unique trait.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Non-sentient beings means…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would include the Lycanthrope I had just hunted, the City Wolves, the City Foxes, and other monsters of that nature. Goblins probably fell under the umbrella as well. It applied to most low-level monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’ll definitely be good in the lower-level period.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most sentient monsters were high-level and tricky to fight. That meant it would be a long time before I came in contact with them, and in the lower-level period, this title would be extremely useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Can’t believe I got two titles in the Tutorial.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a boon I hadn’t even dreamt of. That was something no one in the past had ever achieved. Even the Fist King So Yoohyun only ever got the ‘Tutorial Ender’ title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I even got a skill.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill came with an additional effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A low chance to ignore the prey’s unique trait.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was pretty good in its own way, too, though it was unfortunate it was only a ‘low chance’. Whenever a monster had some kind of unique defense ability, I could pierce through it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hunting the Lycanthrope, I was lost in thought for a moment. It was obscured by buildings, but it felt like I could see it clearly—the D-Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sunhwa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to D-Tower.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the place where we killed the Goblin Soldier, right? The Tutorial Dungeon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, we were heading to the 2nd floor of the D-Tower. So Yoohyun and his group had likely already gone that way. By now…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘They’re probably looking around the 1st floor.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t think they had gone up to the 2nd floor yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oppa, are you thinking about the 2nd floor over there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said it was extremely dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was definitely true. That thing on the 2nd floor wasn’t something that could be hunted by normal means. Even the Fist King So Yoohyun said later that going in there was the thing he regretted most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think about when we first met.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very first time we had met, this child was hardly a match for a baby Goblin. All she could do was beg for help, shaking in fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It hasn’t even been one week, but what do you think will happen if you meet a baby Goblin now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if a Goblin swarm were to appear, with this kid’s physical ability, she would be fine. Sunhwa quickly picked up on what I was trying to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That oppa has become that much stronger? Way more than you expected?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t respond. At that, Sunhwa crossed her arms and nodded, her expression incredibly serious. Then, she mumbled like a sage who had uncovered all of the hidden truths and principles of the world. “Figures, oppa is an outstanding ultra genius, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. I’m also a little confused.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By my original standards, Sunhwa was the real genius, but it seemed like I was even more of a genius than her. Or rather, considering the current situation, that was a fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought of the D-Tower, the 2nd floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s no chance of winning with a direct confrontation.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there were also no tricks that worked on it, like with the Lycanthrope. It was actually a very tricky opponent. That was why I wanted to avoid it, if at all possible, but the situation had changed. I knew that monster very well, and I came to the conclusion that with my current skills, I could definitely kill it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have a plan.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I outlined the plan from start to finish in my head. It would be a lie to say it wouldn’t be dangerous, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can definitely do it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could do it. I had the confidence to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it happen.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire to accomplish and succeed was growing and swirling within my chest, a feeling that was almost a first for me in my entire life. During my days as a civil servant student, I didn’t feel anything like this. One thing was for sure—the current me was different from the past me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to come if you don’t want to. Go to a Safe Zone and hide.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everything went as planned, as I imagined, I would go far beyond simply surviving the Tutorial and would be able to gain something far greater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times had I seized such opportunities in my life? Never.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t had any opportunities. My mom passed early, my sister became sick with leukemia, and I was stuck being a civil servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, it was time for me to seize my chance.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun’s group entered the D-Tower and heard the notice saying it was the Tutorial Dungeon. At the word ‘dungeon’, So Yoohyun brought his guard up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on? There’s nothing here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I was nervous for nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They flattered themselves for having adapted fairly well to the System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it’s a tutorial anyway, right? How strong could something possibly be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, So Yoohyun discovered something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That’s…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He approached an ATM. The ATM screen had been completely torn apart. It looked like something with tremendous torque had punched through it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What the heck could it have been? I haven’t seen such destructive force outside.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goosebumps rose on his arms. That was how terrifying the destructive force appeared to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Not even I could have survived that.’ So Yoohyun had a hunch. ‘Someone… was already here.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed someone had come here, cleared it, and left. At least the 1st floor, that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Who could it have been?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, one person appeared in his mind. He recalled that man with the powerful presence, the man who had been with the young girl. Why that was the case, he didn’t know, but that was the face that came to mind. That very ordinary-looking person had left a strong impression on Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, someone shouted, “Over here! You can click the escalator over here!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like an RPG game. It went without saying that it wasn’t like moving your mouse to actually click on a button. Looking at the escalator with your eyes was enough to know that it was a clickable ‘object’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooldown: Twenty minutes</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people buzzed in excitement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What should we do? Should we try going up to the 2nd floor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These people had already felt that Playing was rather fun. In other words, they were people with the right personality to become ‘Rankers’. Someone who didn’t think Playing was fun could not become a Ranker. After all, thinking of Playing in that way was a type of talent in itself. They felt themselves grow hot with excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Won’t it be dangerous?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other than the 1st and 2nd waves, it wasn’t that dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it’s still a dungeon… and the Tutorial Field will end in a little bit. I have the feeling we shouldn’t overdo it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun fell into deep contemplation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Do we have to go up?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If surviving was his goal, then it would probably be fine to stay here. Did they really have to raid the 2nd floor? It also seemed like monsters didn’t really respawn here, making it a comparatively safe place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you think, Mr. So Yoohyun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, he heard a notice.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a ‘Tutorial Field-wide notice’. The answer was predetermined. So Yoohyun made his decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sounds good. Well, with you around, everything’ll die in one hit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone other than So Yoohyun was full of confidence. They activated the escalator heading to the 2nd floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely unaware of what was waiting for them, they teleported to the ‘Tutorial Dungeon 2nd Floor Raid’ that the Fist King So Yoohyun would later consider his ‘greatest regret’.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes prior</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw the D-Tower in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ended up coming back,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa had followed before, saying,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just want to Play. I think I can be of help, too.” She didn’t have the pros and cons calculations or complicated thoughts adults commonly entertained. She simply followed, all for the vague reason that she might be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t expected we’d be coming back here, either. Gwanghwamun D-Tower, the place with the miniboss monster, the Goblin Soldier. We had come back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We heard a notice, a field-wide notice that rang out in the entirety of the Tutorial Field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a notice hadn’t existed in the history I had studied. It was devastating. If the Tutorial Dungeon wasn’t cleared, all 150,000 people on the field would die.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The quest is different.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation had changed. However—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Me being here is also different.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people who hadn’t existed in the events from ten years ago were here. I didn’t feel all that bothered by the fact the quest had changed. As sudden as it was, I accepted it without a fuss.</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 13: D-Tower 2nd Floor (2)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sung Minchul considered meeting So Yoohyun to be his life’s greatest fortune. In his eyes, So Yoohyun had an enormous talent for ‘Playing’. To put it in other words, he was a genius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let me help you. Come with me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sight of the good natured-looking Yoohyun saving him from getting eaten by a Goblin was still vivid in his mind. Among the Players, So Yoohyun was simply overwhelming. If he stayed with this person, he would probably be able to, at the very least, survive this ‘strange phenomenon’. Sung Minchul didn’t doubt for a moment that this ‘Tutorial Field’ was a field set up for So Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the situation changed a little. Not far away, he saw a green mass of muscle, named a ‘Magic Troll’.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">Magic Troll LVL ?</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its name was red, and its level wasn’t even indicated.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uohhhhhh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll swung its huge fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Argh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun tried to block it, but the situation wasn’t looking too good. From the way his left arm dangled afterwards, it looked like his shoulder was dislocated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah! Haah! Haah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun looked exhausted. Sung Minchul barely managed to sit up, blood dripping from his mouth. Next to him were people who had died in one hit of that fist. Whether they had fainted, or died, he wasn’t sure, but they were most likely dead. He didn’t have the luxury of checking. In any case, the only people who still had their heads on straight were Minchul himself and So Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minchul wiped the blood from his lips with his sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dammit…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a feeling… that he would die here. If, by some chance, someone were to get out of this place alive, it wouldn’t be him. It wasn’t as if he didn’t consider running away, but…</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You cannot flee.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn’t flee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I might… die here.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, there was a high chance he would die here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m going to die.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear swelled within him. He truly regretted his bravado before coming to the 2nd floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yoohyun’s right fist glowed blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aahhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He punched out, hitting the green monster, the ‘troll’, squarely in the side. That fist that had smashed every monster up until now had no effect this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a resounding impact, but the troll merely frowned a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Dammit!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even So Yoohyun felt like he was fighting a massive wall. But just then, he heard another notice.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[New Players are entering.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minchul and Yoohyun turned to look at the escalator at the same time. Minchul cried out, “Run!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten seconds. They only had ten seconds left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can still run within ten seconds!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they didn’t go back on the escalator within ten seconds, they would be trapped here. He saw a young girl, a child in her early teens at best. Suddenly, tears welled up in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Mina.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a daughter exactly around that age. She had just become a middle school student. His daughter’s face came to mind and seemed to overlap with the face of the girl he saw. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be great if that child didn’t die,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he thought. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s not my daughter, but it would be great if she lived.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It would be great if she didn’t come here. Because if she did, the only thing that awaited her was a brutal death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This guy can never, ever be killed, so hurry and get out of here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether they heard his words or not, the two people walked over from the escalator not far into the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please! Please, run. Can’t you hear me? Don’t you see this crazy monster?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had walked over here just as gallantly, thinking that no matter how strong the monster might look, it was still the Tutorial Field, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tutorial, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they had So Yoohyun. Because he was with a person who had been born to Play. That conceit had been shattered in just one minute. It was obvious that the same would happen to the newcomers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be reckless and go back! It’s too dangerous!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please go back. Don’t come to this harsh place and die.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of impact rang out. It was the sound of So Yoohyun getting hit. Taking the troll’s fist to his head, Yoohyun fainted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kim Hyukjin came ever closer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you to aim for the left eye, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin walked towards the troll, not too fast or too suddenly. Though the troll was that large, it was as fast as a lithe tiger. He walked slowly on purpose, judging it wouldn’t be good to draw aggro while he still didn’t have a good grasp on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he was walking, he heard a shout that was nearly a scream, but he ignored it. After coming closer, he saw the troll’s information in his mind.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">Magic Troll LVL ?</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name was written in red, indicating that it was absolutely not a monster Hyukjin could easily kill. In fact, it was likely a very difficult opponent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little ways to the side, he saw So Yoohyun lying unconscious after getting hit in the head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s a monster that can go up against the Fist King So Yoohyun.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troll was a monster with incredibly good vitality. It was also extremely resilient. Moreover, it happened to have a particularly high resistance to ‘fist attacks’. With the addition of the boss monster stat buff, the troll was definitely a tricky opponent, a boss monster that required you to stack on continuous damage with frontal methods.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ is watching you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Lady of the Scales’ is watching you.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed even the Guardians thought the current Kim Hyukjin couldn’t kill the troll. However, he didn’t run. Instead, he continued to advance. The notices continued to stream in.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Nameless Observer’ has high hopes for you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Lady of the Scales’ marvels at your heroic appearance.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nameless Observer seemed to want to observe how Hyukjin would kill the troll, while the Lady of the Scales was more interested in how he would save the survivors here. The two Guardians wanted slightly different things, but in any case, there was no mistake that Hyukjin had to defeat the troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pulled out the ‘Iron Sword’ and checked his ‘slots’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I memorized how to use them.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he used the slots, he didn’t have to physically drink the potions. Items moved to his slots could be used immediately simply by willing it. It was like a keyboard shortcut in a game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m all ready to go.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was scared. Originally, he would have never come into this place. But now, he had the ‘Item Shop’. He had potions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Besides its enormous resilience, its actual attack power isn’t that high.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact most of So Yoohyun’s group was still alive was proof of that. They were scattered on the ground, almost all of them unconscious. It lacked the intelligence to check whether the people were dead or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troll could be defined as such: a dumb monster with strong resilience and constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin said, “Sunhwa. Those people aren’t dead yet. They’re not corpses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa flinched in surprise. Her face flushed a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I didn’t think they were dead. Really. I wasn’t thinking bad thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not what I mean. Put this in their mouths.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He handed her recovery potions, which he had stocked up from the Item Shop. With these, they would be out of the woods for the time being. It was the final act of conscience he could offer after having turned away from so many people. He didn’t intend to die for them, but he could still save them from dying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is all I can do for them.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting out of here alive was their responsibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they happen to regain consciousness, be sure to tell them not to move and just stay still. Tell them not to attack,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Kim Hyukjin thought he had done everything he could, he looked forward again.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">Magic Troll LVL ?</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster that looked like the Hulk stared in Hyukjin’s direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The Fist King of the past managed to kill something like this.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there were differences from the past and now. Other than So Yoohyun, everyone here had died. There was also a high chance that Yoohyun had been the one who had hunted the miniboss, the Goblin Soldier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘As a result, the Tutorial’s Fist King has become as much weaker as I have grown stronger.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which meant—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘His current skills are lacking.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoohyun was still unconscious. Hyukjin walked close, but not close enough to greatly provoke the troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It has great resilience and moves quickly, but its attacking speed is slow.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn’t any real strat. You had to slowly, steadily pile on the damage over a long period of time. That meant the challenger had to last a long time, too, something that was possible with potions.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mass of muscle began to stomp its way over. It was fast.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The ‘Excellent Hunter’ title is taking effect.]</div>
</div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoosh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within mere moments, a huge fist came swinging his way. However, Hyukjin could follow that fist clearly with his eyes. He couldn’t quite read the next movement or perfectly track its path, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can see the trajectory.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, at this moment, he could see exactly how that fist would swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Duck my head.’</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoosh–!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll’s fist swept past the hairs on his head. As expected of its enormous size, the attack carried a certain degree of strength, but that meant nothing if it didn’t land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyukjin thrust his sword into the troll’s abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s not hitting.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like how Hyukjin had read the troll’s movements, the troll had read his as well. Their speeds were evenly matched, victor or loser not apparent to the eye. With the buff of the ‘Excellent Hunter’ title, their speeds were equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Okay.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He opened his Status Window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undistributed stats: 6</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was level 15. Thanks to getting random stats for whatever reason, his stats were a far cry from a regular level 15 Player. A regular Player would have stats like these at level 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘6 undistributed stats.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When fighting the lycanthrope, he had used the ‘High Strength Elixir’. Back then, he physically experienced how big an effect ‘+6’ had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Put them all in Agility.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troll had high resilience, but its ‘defense’ wasn’t actually so high that it couldn’t take damage.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Agility increased.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Agility increased.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding +6 to Agility, his current Agility was 23. As his Agility stat shot up, he felt his body grow lighter. He could see the troll’s movements more precisely, and with his increased speed, Hyukjin began to gain the upper hand.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uooogh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troll swung its fists. Hyukjin dodged and struck repeatedly, hunting the troll while continuously avoiding close calls. From afar, Sung Minchul stared in a daze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Even So Yoohyun was at its mercy, but…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single person was fighting a monster that not just So Yoohyun, but all fifteen people who had come here, hadn’t been able to touch. Though the fight looked so dicey it seemed as if the Player could be blown away at any moment, he was hunting the troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’s soloing it?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s always someone better. That was what people said. Watching the scene before him now, Sung Minchul felt it was true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How can he be like that?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had been Playing for the same amount of time, so how could that man handle such a monster on his own?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is he… the real genius?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His talent was so overwhelming it made even So Yoohyun, someone Minchul had thought of as a genius, look like an ordinary Joe. A crème de la crème level of talent that relegated geniuses to normalcy. A kind of skill reaching a different world, a domain that couldn’t be approached by any amount of effort. Minchul felt that the man he saw had that kind of talent, skill, and something more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, that was how the situation played out for Sung Minchul. One hour passed with him watching in awe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood flowed from the troll’s left eye. I breathed raggedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah…! Haah…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troll was estimated to be level 25. With the boss monster stat buff, the constitution of the ‘Magic Troll’ was beyond imagination. Despite that, I didn’t feel all that desperate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can do this.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fighting the Magic Troll, I felt it again. The Magic Troll wasn’t an impossible foe to hunt. For Players of the Tutorial level, it was considered as a foe that couldn’t be soloed, but that wasn’t true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can definitely kill it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could kill it normally, without any tricks. As I fought, I could certainly feel that I was most likely a genius.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I hadn’t gotten to this point on talent and strategies alone. There was definitely some item abuse going on. ‘Potion abuse’, to be exact. I was only managing by chugging two potions in one go, but without potions, I would have really fallen over. But now, the end was nearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because they were suffering under the special ability of the ‘Magic Troll’, the people seemed to have no intention of stirring. They had been unconscious for one hour. If they at least woke up, if So Yoohyun at least woke up, he could help out a little, but it didn’t matter—it was almost over. The troll was as exhausted as I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to wait. Right now, I had to bide my time. A little later, every piece of the puzzle would come together. The time was coming for me to put the final stroke on the picture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just then, a kink occurred in my plans.</span></p>

<p><b>Chapter 14: This is When I’m the Cheapest</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Gotta take my time with the final blow.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to take my time killing the Troll. According to the strategies I had seen, a delay of at least fifteen minutes was necessary. Otherwise, yet another change would occur in the Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Let’s put in one more hit and then wait.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Iron Sword was about to hit the Troll’s left eye, when—</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[The ‘Courageous Lion King’ wishes to help you.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I instantly stilled, but it was already too late to draw back my sword. The tip of the Iron Sword went into the Troll’s left eye.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ‘Courageous Lion King’ has gifted you ‘Superb Superhuman Strength’, and it has taken effect.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Due to ‘Superb Superhuman Strength’, the attack power of this attack has increased by 100%.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I instantly came to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Dammit.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no doubt that the damned Courageous Lion King had been waiting for this moment. He was probably snickering, [Now. Show me your courage.] If one day, I had the chance to beat a Guardian to death, that Guardian would be my first target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s too late.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I had intended on being a light hit had become a finishing blow. I had dealt too powerful an attack without a delay. Now, the Troll’s counterattack would begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before I retracted my sword, I made a decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have to run.’</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plunge!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Sword plunged into the Magic Troll’s left eye.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ting!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, an arrow flew out of nowhere and embedded itself in the middle of the Magic Troll’s forehead along with a triumphant “I did it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the guys that had been unconscious near the Troll had fired an arrow. His name was Jang Hyunsoo. He had received a bow as his random weapon and was a pretty good hand at it. Actually, it had been quite a while since he regained consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you come to, don’t do anything and just stay still. That’s what oppa said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jang Hyunsoo had heard those words. He had remained lying down in fear, because if he accidentally drew the Troll’s aggro, he would die. After praying for what seemed like an eternity for that man to somehow kill the Troll, he opened his eyes to discover a shocking scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What the hell? Holy shit. It’s almost dead.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monster that even So Yoohyun couldn’t kill was almost hunted by a man who didn’t look all that special. Hyunsoo hadn’t even imagined that there was a Player stronger than So Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s really almost over?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this Troll fell, the Tutorial would end. Once his desire to survive was satisfied, a different kind of greed began to bud within him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If I put in the finishing blow…!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would be a lot of rewards for simply dealing the finishing hit. Even though he couldn’t grab all the rewards, he thought he would be able to get at least half. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I don’t really need to stay still… just because that little girl told me to, right?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could just say he hadn’t heard her. Or he could just say he helped that man with no consideration for his own life because it looked dangerous. There were plenty of excuses or justifications he could use.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[Using the skill Strengthened Arrow.]</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He let his arrow fly. The big Troll made a large target, and he was lucky this time, managing to plant the arrow precisely in the middle of the Troll’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s a success!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He successfully dealt the final blow. The Troll staggered. It seemed as though the Tutorial’s boss monster, the ‘Magic Troll’, would disappear like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I was the one who killed the boss monster! I killed it!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was possible he might become stronger than So Yoohyun. His heart began to thump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Reward! What’s the reward?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smile floated unbidden to his lips at the thought of the reward. He felt like he was getting a reward that matched all of his struggles up to this point. He had killed a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boss monster</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hyukjin, who had run over, asked him a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final blow wasn’t the end. This man had made a mistake just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think you must have dealt the final blow just now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change occurred in the Magic Troll. At the same time, notices began to stream in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you want to live, run. I can’t save you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll’s gaze turned to Jang Hyunsoo. Unlike what the Courageous Lion King had planned, Hyunsoo was the one who drew the aggro.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa fed people Constitution Pots as she glanced stealthily at Kim Hyukjin, who was breathing hard as he fought the Magic Troll for over an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s been over one hour.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over that time, Sunhwa had continued to pour potions into people’s mouths, never forgetting to warn them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Fortunately, I don’t think anyone died.’ There was only one person left. ‘That’s the last person I have to feed.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving carefully, she headed to the remaining person, So Yoohyun. She straightened the unconscious man on the ground and tilted open his mouth, then began to pour in a potion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa fed So Yoohyun, a man of the same age as Kim Hyukjin, a second potion. She didn’t have the time to check the skill at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mister, wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At long last, So Yoohyun began to regain consciousness like the others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a reason why I wanted to take my time dealing the final blow. If you killed the Magic Troll in one hit, it would go into a ‘berserker state’, a state of ultimate agitation. That monster wasn’t something the current me could defeat, no matter how hard I struggled. It was a monster that had to be killed slowly, leaving plenty of time in between blows.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuaaaagghhh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll’s green skin began to turn red, and sinew bulged out all over its body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sunhwa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Run.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, I ran ahead of her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuaaaagghhh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll started running towards the archer who had dealt it the final blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can’t tell whether this is good or bad luck.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really couldn’t tell, and I didn’t have the leisure to contemplate it. I didn’t even look behind me. The berserk Troll could kill with a touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reddened Troll grabbed the archer by the ankles and lifted him upside down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“U-Uaaaaaghhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, the Troll slammed him down again and again to the left and right.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thud! Thud!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With each thump, the archer’s screams became weaker and weaker. I could tell without even looking. The sounds told me everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That has to be… instant death.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn’t even time to light a candle, to pray for the man’s departed soul. The berserk Troll’s movements were even faster than the lycanthrope’s. I swiftly activated the escalator prompt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurry and run!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used the escalator to move to the 1st floor. The Boss Monster Zone had been deactivated and no longer restricted the use of the escalator. For now, I had to escape, no matter what. I wasn’t able to pay any attention to the people collapsed on the 2nd floor, and I didn’t know what was going on up there. I simply prayed that they would survive on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I slightly bit my lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A variable.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had failed to account for possible variables. Only a god could know everything. This was a learning experience. I had learned my lesson, so in the future, I would include variables like this into my calculations. The scheming of Guardians, their enjoyment, all of it had to be included in my future raids and calculations. I really learned my lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Oppa, what happened?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dunno, run.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no time to explain. We had to run and see. I didn’t know how this guy’s D-Tower was structured, but it didn’t look like the escalator continued running down to other floors. The elevator to go down was a bit far away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t a real elevator. There happened to be one on the 1st floor, but it wasn’t possible to prompt an explanation window. It didn’t work. Right now, we weren’t safe. There was no knowing when that crazy Troll would come down and bash in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over there. Let’s go down the stairs.” My eyes fell on the stairs. “We just have to reach the 2nd floor underground.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa worked hard to follow me. I opened the emergency door and ran down the emergency stairs, heading for the 2nd underground floor. It was the ‘Additional Safe Zone’ only I had heard of, the ‘D-Tower underground 2nd floor parking lot’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as we ran, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thud thud thud thud!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of massive footsteps came from above. It almost sounded like a dinosaur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Shit!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How was a creature two meters in size with that kind of bulk able to move so fast? It almost felt like an earthquake was shaking the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We have to run faster.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, it had finished its business on the 2nd floor, because it made a beeline for me. Currently, I was on the 1st underground floor. I dragged Sunhwa along. Sunhwa had extremely good resilience, but her constitution itself wasn’t that great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Run faster!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gripped Sunhwa’s thin wrist hard in one hand, starting to drag her down the stairs. She was tripping, but there was no time to pay any attention to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She won’t be hurt by this.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her body had been completely unhurt by a Goblin’s dagger. Even if I roughly towed her along, she wouldn’t get any big injuries, just a few scratches, at the most. Ending up with a few scratches was way better than getting smashed to pieces by a berserking Troll.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hah! Hah! Hah!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gasped for air.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll’s footsteps sounded closer and closer, until I could even hear the growl of its breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why’s the 2nd underground floor so far?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw a sign saying we were heading towards the 2nd underground floor. I ran with all my strength towards that destination, the Safe Zone. And then, I saw the door going into the 2nd underground floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a fire door, the type that could be opened by pushing the bar. I slammed my weight into it to open it, and as I did so, the Magic Troll was right on our tail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Oppa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The berserking Troll with only the whites of its eyes visible punched out.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Shit.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the sound of an exploding bomb, the fire door crumpled like a piece of paper. I had survived by swiftly ducking, but if that fist had hit me, I would have flown to the heavens. My hair stood on end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why the hell are there two layers of fire doors?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to open another one to go inside. Only then could we enter the 2nd underground floor parking lot. Somehow, the fire door felt impossibly heavy today. I pushed it open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a shiver run down my back and knew. The Troll was readying its fist again behind us. I couldn’t describe it exactly, but I somehow knew. The back of my head was tingling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Definitely.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">somehow,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I felt it. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it, even without seeing it. The trajectory of its fist, and the end of its trajectory, were outlined in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no time to pay attention to that notice. However, ‘Sixth Sense’ vividly sketched out what was happening behind me in my head. I could see, without looking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll’s swinging fist, where that fist would land, how fast it would travel—everything was naturally laid out before me. How I should act to avoid that fist, what kind of movement I should show, it was all clear to me, as if I were someone who had been trained to perfection. The outcomes of ten different actions were all instantly sketched out in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the result of that calculation was clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can’t dodge.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was absolutely nowhere to evade. No matter how I moved, no matter how I dodged, no matter how I blocked, the result of each and every action was my death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m gonna die.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fear of death filled my head to the brim… for one moment. For a very short millisecond, what felt like a long time to me, my innate ability, ‘Sixth Sense’, loudly proclaimed my death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, a miracle occurred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa could definitely feel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If I take that hit instead, I’ll die.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chances of that happening were high. She didn’t have Kim Hyukjin’s ‘Sixth Sense’, but she was indeed a talent worthy of being called a ‘genius’. She could at least feel very clearly that if she took that attack, she could die.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I have to block it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t think about it for long. She merely thought that she could lose her life, not what would happen if she didn’t or what she could gain by doing such a thing. She </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">had </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to block it. If she didn’t, Kim Hyukjin’s head would be bashed in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m going to block it!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a calculated action. She didn’t stop to weigh the pros and cons. She was simply going to block it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I will!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, all she thought about was protecting Hyukjin. And so, she extended her hand.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">

</div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clang!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clang as loud as two hollow aluminum baseball bats colliding burst out. It was the sound of the Troll’s meaty fist glancing off Kang Sunhwa’s thin arm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa blocked the Magic Troll’s fist with her thin arm. To be exact, she slightly redirected the fist’s ‘trajectory’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lost consciousness before she could even scream. Hyukjin didn’t look behind him to see what happened. He had no time to do so. He just ran, hauling Sunhwa along while clenching his teeth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Sunhwa used a new ability.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know what it was, but it seemed like a Tutorial bonus, as well as a skill she hadn’t used before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even amidst my desperate scramble to flee, I came to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It must be one of the beginner skills given by the Lady of the Scales.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lady of the Scales happened to be watching the Intermediate Administrator ‘Senia’s’ channel. That meant she was watching this scene just like the others. From that, I could guess what kind of ability had just blocked the Magic Troll’s attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Platinum Shield.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Sunhwa had protected him by using Platinum Shield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘For a regular Player, even if they used Platinum Shield… no matter where they were hit, it would be instant death.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because it was Sunhwa. Because it was Sunhwa, a girl whose talent for tanking exceeded genius. She was still at an age where her ‘talent plates’ had probably not yet bloomed, and yet despite that, she managed to block the Magic Troll’s attack. This could only be seen as a miracle achieved by Sunhwa’s talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We’re almost at the Safe Zone!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The archer Player’s helpful but also not helpful kill steal earned me some time, and Sunhwa’s Platinum Shield earned me some more. To me, all of this was a miracle, a miracle that allowed me to leap over the Lion King’s evil scheme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I displayed a burst of superhuman strength, dragging Sunhwa along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We just have to get past that glass door.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we were past the glass door, it would be the ‘parking lot’ field, a place that was still valid as a Safe Zone. That was the Safe Zone only I had heard about. I hurled myself forward, Sunhwa in my embrace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The glass shattered, and I rolled on the ground, holding onto Sunhwa.</span></p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">[You have entered the extra Safe Zone, ‘D-Tower Parking Lot 2nd Floor’.]</div>
</div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuooooogh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if blocked by a transparent wall, the Troll was unable to come in. Infuriated, it battered the invisible wall with its fists like crazy, but it wasn’t at the level of a ruthless monster that could break through a Safe Zone setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Sunhwa! Get a hold of yourself. Kang Sunhwa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her arm was limp. She had taken on that crazy Troll’s destructive force with such a slender arm. It appeared the shock of impact had traveled up her shoulder into her insides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried putting a potion into her mouth, but it was no use. She remained in a state of just barely breathing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuoooooogh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll continued to batter the barrier. The look in its eyes was like blazing flames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’ll die in a few minutes.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bit my lips. The monster had about ⅓ of its HP left. A berserking Magic Troll would be able to release tremendous power, but it wouldn’t be able to handle that power for long and would die. The more intensely it moved, the faster its HP would drain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dammit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunhwa was still as unconscious as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Sixth Sense, the exact trajectory had been drawn out in my head. I had perceived it mentally, but my body simply hadn’t been able to react. Sunhwa hadn’t been a factor in that trajectory—she had forcibly butted in, slightly redirecting the Troll’s fist. Thanks to that, I had survived and Kang Sunhwa ended up on the verge of death. She had put out her arm for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glared at the berserking Magic Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You piece of shit.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Troll’s HP was nearly completely drained. To the very end, it burned the flame of its lifeforce with frenzied rage.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oooooooooghh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a terrible shriek, the Troll rampaged outside the Safe Zone it could not trespass. And then, it bravely died a natural death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way a Player under level 20 could possibly kill a berserking Magic Troll. As long as you could survive purely out of luck, the System would recognize you as killing the Magic Troll. In the past, that person was probably So Yoohyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Player Kim Hyukjin. You have been recognized as the Player who hunted the Magic Troll.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t feel very happy. Without realizing it, I glared at Senia. The Streamer Senia, and the Guardians who turned the world like this so they could watch for their amusement, they were all on the same side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, field-wide notices rang out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In accordance with the death of the Tutorial Field Boss Monster, the Tutorial Field will be deactivated.]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know if that number was important, but it was the #1 recurring question in the civil servant exam. I knew exactly what that number was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘5087 people.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the number while cradling the unconscious Sunhwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s the same.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To my surprise, it was exactly the same as the past. I had survived, and although she was unconscious, so had Sunhwa. That meant there should at least be two more survivors. But the number of survivors was exactly the same, down to the last digit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I administered emergency treatment, feeding Sunhwa healing potions so that she could hold onto the ember of life for just a few seconds longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I can save her.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could do it. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">had </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The level cap is lifted.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general rewards were given out, but I didn’t pay much attention to those notices. Right now, the collapsed Sunhwa required my attention more. My mind whirled, drawing out the next events and how exactly I could save Sunhwa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert-maxtalent">
<div class="wrapper-div">

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I already knew this would happen. I knew how to get the Tutorial Ender title. I had planned on not making the Troll berserk by slowly shaving away at it until it died, but my plans had gone slightly awry. However, I didn’t regret not getting the title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘On the 2nd floor of the D-Tower… the only survivor is So Yoohyun.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone else had died, even the man who had yelled at me to run away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s the same as the past.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senia. We agreed to make a deal, didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hadn’t negotiated the deal yet. After killing the miniboss monster, the Goblin Soldier, the deal had been delayed. But now, I intended on settling it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, “I’m sure many prominent Guardians have entered your channel. They must also be paying attention to you, the one who snagged a mutant Player like me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the Nameless Observer, a Guardian even I didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Lady of the Scales. The Courageous Lion King. The two of them alone are Guardians with plenty of capital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Nameless Observer personally sponsored me with more Coins than the Lady of the Scales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia was probably well aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the very start, I have proven my value.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia didn’t say anything. She had no choice but to acknowledge my words as the truth. No one, not even So Yoohyun, who had gotten the Tutorial Ender title, had been able to show a Play as exciting as mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even an Intermediate Administrator as talentless as you should be able to survive… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have good quality content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Though I do not agree with your evaluation of me as talentless, I do acknowledge that I need good quality content to survive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia stared at me with her usual expressionless face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Tutorial Field has ended, and the opening act is finished. Now, the true Tutorial mode will begin. Correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia was unperturbed. Although this was something no regular Player should know, and I had been acting like I had a strategy guide on hand, she didn’t show much reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want you to raise the grade of my Item Shop. Right now. The Tutorial is over, so I don’t think it’s an excessive request.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short moment of silence, Senia said, “I do not think that is a very sensible method. You have proven your worth. You have the right to demand more from me. Also, the Item Shop—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will naturally have its restrictions lifted with time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. It is a problem that time will solve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, it was restricted to the ‘Tutorial-grade’. However, with the passage of time, the Item Shop’s grade would naturally rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my eyes, I saw the barely breathing Sunhwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will buy that time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tutorial Field had been deactivated. As such, changing the Item Shop’s grade from ‘Tutorial’ to ‘Beginner’ with the authority of an Intermediate Administrator wasn’t all that hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The reason I want to save Sunhwa is&#8230;’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she had an unprecedented talent for tanking? Or because she was a jewel in the rough with incredible hidden potential? No, my reason for saving her was nothing that grand. Right now, it was ‘because I want to save her’. Sunhwa would have done the same for me, without any calculations of profit and loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I faced Senia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll make an exclusive contract with you. For one year, no other Intermediate Administrator will be able to observe me. The Guardians will only be able to watch me through you, no matter what.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia’s eyes grew wide. Of course she did, since I had already offered a ‘Player-Intermediate Administrator exclusive contract’ as a card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Player Kim Hyukjin. Just exactly how much do you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “That’s not important. What’s important is—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senia’s wingtips trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That I have caught the attention of many Guardians. That I’m the only Player to have already received thousands of Coins. And that I’m a Ranker who lifted the Tutorial Field’s level cap ahead of time. I’m sure the rumors will spread amongst the Intermediate Administrators as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Remember this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now. This is when I’m the cheapest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hammered in the final nail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t take me up now, there will be no next time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was confident, confident that Senia would have no other choice than to accept my proposal. Sure enough, I heard a notice.</span></p>
